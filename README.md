# 🛍 Retail Loss Analysis

**Comprehensive data analysis project for the retail domain — built entirely in Python.**  

The notebook explores **three analytical scenarios** in retail analytics:

1. **Decline in Revenue — Root Cause Analysis**  
   Identify when and why revenue dropped, analyze affected categories, and find contributing factors.

2. **Promotion / Discount Effectiveness**  
   Evaluate whether marketing promotions drove real incremental sales or just cannibalized existing demand.

3. **Returns & Loss Analysis**  
   Quantify the impact of returns on net revenue and identify categories responsible for the highest refund rates.
