# üõç Retail Loss Analysis

**Comprehensive data analysis project for the retail domain ‚Äî built entirely in Python.**  
This project demonstrates how a data analyst approaches real business questions using synthetic retail data.

## üìä Project Overview

The notebook explores **three analytical scenarios** that commonly arise in retail analytics:

1. **üìâ Decline in Revenue ‚Äî Root Cause Analysis**  
   Identify when and why revenue dropped, analyze affected categories, and find contributing factors.

2. **üí∏ Promotion / Discount Effectiveness**  
   Evaluate whether marketing promotions drove real incremental sales or just cannibalized existing demand.

3. **‚Ü©Ô∏è Returns & Loss Analysis**  
   Quantify the impact of returns on net revenue and identify categories responsible for the highest refund rates.

## üß† Data Analyst Workflow

Each section follows the typical analytical process:

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **1. Question Definition** | Define the business problem and analytical goal |
| **2. Data Preparation** | Generate or clean transaction-level data |
| **3. EDA & Visualization** | Explore trends, anomalies, and relationships |
| **4. Insights & Hypotheses** | Interpret data patterns |
| **5. Recommendations** | Suggest next analytical or business actions |

## üßæ Datasets (synthetic examples)

All data is automatically generated by the notebook and saved as CSVs in `/mnt/data/`:

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `retail_transactions.csv` | Daily transactions with products, prices, discounts, customers |
| `retail_promotions.csv` | Promotion periods and discount levels |
| `retail_returns.csv` | Returned orders with refund amounts |
| `retail_customers.csv` | Customer base with segments |

## üìà Example Outputs

- Revenue trends with 7-day smoothing to detect decline periods  
- Category-level breakdown during dip windows  
- Bar charts comparing promo vs pre-promo periods  
- Refund rate analysis per product category

---

## üéØ Key Insights

- Temporary revenue declines can be identified via time series smoothing.  
- Some promotions show clear revenue uplift; others need A/B validation.  
- Returns may reduce total revenue by ~3‚Äì5%, with apparel and electronics most affected.

## üß© Next Steps

- Integrate real transaction data (e.g., from ERP or CRM)  
- Add cohort and RFM analysis for customer retention  
- Build an interactive dashboard (e.g., in Superset or Power BI)
